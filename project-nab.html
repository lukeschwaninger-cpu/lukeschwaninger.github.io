      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This project focused on the microscale mechanical and compositional characterization of
        additively manufactured (AM) Nickel Aluminum Bronze (NAB), a material commonly used in marine
        environments for its corrosion resistance and strength. Using Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF),
        the goal was to compare microstructural and mechanical performance with cast NAB.

      <h2>Methods</h2>
      <p>
        Techniques included Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX),
        microhardness testing, and nanoindentation. Samples were prepared and polished for cross-sectional
        mapping, and data were analyzed to quantify hardness and modulus across various grain and phase boundaries.

      <h2>Key Findings</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>AM NAB exhibited finer microstructures and higher hardness than traditional cast NAB.</li>
        <li>Grain refinement and phase uniformity contributed to improved mechanical stability.</li>
        <li>Preliminary corrosion data showed reduced pit density on AM NAB surfaces after immersion testing.</li>
      </ul>
