          The CanKrusher is a fully automated recycling system designed for convenience and sustainability. The only user interaction steps are: plug in, set can in, empty recyling bin when full.
          
          Engineered with a compact footprint suitable for countertop use and powered by an electric actuator system, it automates the crushing of aluminum cans into thin discs with minimal user input. The design features a 6-can magazine, adaptive sizing for standard, tall, and skinny cans, and a smooth automatic cycle triggered by onboard sensors. Built from precision-cut components and oak framing, the project blends an automated mechanical function with aesthetic craftsmanship. This prototype fixes your constantly overfilled recycling bins, while maintaining a satisfying and asthetically pleasing experience for the user. Currently in final development, it represents an intersection of prototyping, automation, and product design aimed at both consumer and small commercial use.

          <h3>Quick Notes</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Focus:</strong> Make recylcing fun to encourage sustainability.</li>
            <li><strong>Next Milestone (1):</strong> Integrate upgraded electronics system and reduce to one wall outlet plug (currently 2 plugs).</li>
            <li><strong>Next Milestone (2):</strong> Address jamming issue when cycling through cans of different sizes. This should be a quick geometric-related fix to the laser cut magazine.</li>
            <li><strong>Next Milestone (3):</strong> Stain the wood and laser engrave with logo.</li>
            <li><strong>Call to Action:</strong> Show this to your friends and contact me for suggestions or information.</li>
