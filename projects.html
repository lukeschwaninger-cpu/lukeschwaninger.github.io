          The CanKrusher is a fully automated recycling system designed for convenience and sustainability. The only user interaction steps are: plug in, set can in, empty recyling bin when full.
        </p>
        <p>
          Engineered with a compact footprint suitable for countertop use and powered by an electric actuator system, it automates the crushing of aluminum cans into thin discs with minimal user input. The design features a 6-can magazine, adaptive sizing for standard, tall, and skinny cans, and a smooth automatic cycle triggered by onboard sensors. Built from precision-cut components and oak framing, the project blends an automated mechanical function with aesthetic craftsmanship. This prototype fixes your constantly overfilled recycling bins, while maintaining a satisfying and asthetically pleasing experience for the user. Currently in final development, it represents an intersection of prototyping, automation, and product design aimed at both consumer and small commercial use.

          <h3>Quick Notes</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Focus:</strong> Make recylcing fun to encourage sustainability.</li>
            <li><strong>Next Milestone (1):</strong> Integrate upgraded electronics system and reduce to one wall outlet plug (currently 2 plugs).</li>
            <li><strong>Next Milestone (2):</strong> Address jamming issue when cycling through cans of different sizes. This should be a quick geometric-related fix to the laser cut magazine.</li>
            <li><strong>Next Milestone (3):</strong> Stain the wood and laser engrave with logo.</li>

          My homemade shotgun sling was made for a fabrics project in the Making for Innovation class at UNL. I made this out of brown canvas, cotton padding, nylon webbing, elastic strap, and shotgun sling amounts. This project took me about four hours to complete with little knowledge of how to use a sewing machine. I first took rough measurements by mocking it up against my shoulder to see the length of sling I would need. Then I sewed on the elastic strap to hold the shells and made the inner padding section as shown in the video. For the outer layer I sewed a tube then rolled it inside out so sewing seam was hidden. Then I sewed all the pieces together and it turned out better than expected.

          My 3D printing project in the Making For Innovation class was a phone holder for a vehicle air vent. The idea was to have a 3D print that holds a phone securely through several flanges that pinch onto the air vent fins. This worked very well at first however since PLA is a thermoplastic, once the heat is turned on in the car, the flanges on the back warped and no longer fit securely. A different plastic material needs to be considered in the redesign of this project.

          <h2>New Website</h2>
          <p class="project-status"><strong>Status:</strong> September 2025.</p>
        </header>

          This website is one of my recent projects that was recommended by one of my professors. The goal is to have a landing page that summarizes me as a young engineer to let the world know a little bit about myself, my interests, and what I've been up to.
        </p>
        <p>
          The workflow of creating my website started out by looking at other people's personal website portfolios online. I then created my own style using Github to create my main HTML. I then created my CSS file to get the website looking how I wanted it to. From there I started building out my other website pages such as research, books, social and kept updating and iterating as I went. Once it started to look nice I bought my domain on Squarespace to make it my own.
        </p>
        <p>
          Creating this website has been a great learning curve as I had zero experience with HTML's before. Just as I like building projects in the physical world I enjoyed creating this virtual and online project as well. I hope people will use this as a resource learn more about me and reach out to have conversation over similar interests!
